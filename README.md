# gist

> gist is an obvious little program; it gists.

It was created out of a dissatisfaction over other gisting libraries. This gist uses a temporary `nano` text editor (it shall soon be a configurable editor). It then reads a little description and uploads it; then gives you the link.

Contributions are very much welcome. This is my first Python project and the code may or may not be horrendous.

#### Installation
```bash
$ sudo ./install.sh
$ python src/main.py
```

If you have a good way to put it into `$PATH`, please pull request! :)
